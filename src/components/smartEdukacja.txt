SmartEdukacja is my biggest project so far. It is a portal that allows you to post tutoring ads and allows you to view and browse them using a map. It allows you to create an account, create new ads, delete and edit existing ones, and of course to filter ads. For the site, I also created a database using MySQL and backend using Node.js and Express. I am still working on the site improving the code and adding new features.
