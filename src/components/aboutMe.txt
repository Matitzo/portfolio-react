Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mateusz and I am a self-taught frontend developer specializing in ReactJS. My journey in programming started during my studies in geodesy, where I encountered programming for the first time and learned Python and MySQL. From that moment on, I knew that programming was my true passion.
I have dedicated countless hours to mastering ReactJS and I am always eager to expand my skillset by learning new technologies and techniques. I take great pride in creating user-friendly and good looking web applications that provide seamless user experiences. My goal is to bring ideas to life and to help businesses and individuals achieve their online objectives.
Aside from programming, I have a strong interest in science, gaming, technology, and fitness. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry, playing video games, and hitting the gym to stay active and healthy. When I have some free time I also like to read books.
Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. Please feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or if you would like to collaborate on a project.
